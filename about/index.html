      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <img class="img-circle" src="/images/IMG_9486.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="140" height="140">
      <h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Origins</h4>
      <p>
         The Worcester Free Store opened March 26 of 2016, in a studio at the <a href="http://www.theworcshop.com/" target="_blank">WorcShop</a> on Stafford St. In the first month of our opening we gave away over 2400 items. On April 24th, in the Austin liquors parking lot on Park Avenue, the Worcester Free Store had its first community popup event. We were able to give away over 300 items to the community.
      </p>
      <p>The incredible reception that we have received from the community has allowed for the Free Store to prosper in a way that was unexpected, allowing for us to move to our current location on Cambridge Street.</p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Recycling</h4>
      <p>We are constantly working to improve and expand recycling programs which will offer to the residents of Worcester opportunities to recycle items like appliances, tires, and computers in increasingly more easy ways. </p>
      <h4>We Want to Grow to Better Serve the Community</h4>
      <p>We are actively working on relationships with the homeless shelters, Women's shelters, hospitals, and local fire departments. Developing these relationships will allow us to provide more services and items for the community. We are looking to grow by partnering with local organizations and the community as a whole.</p>
